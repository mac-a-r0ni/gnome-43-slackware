Tracker is an efficient search engine and triplestore for desktop, embedded and mobile.

The Tracker project is divided into two main repositories:

Tracker SPARQL contains the triplestore database, provided as the libtracker-sparql library and implemented using SQLite. This repo also contains the database ontologies and the commandline user interface (tracker3).

Tracker Miners contains the indexer daemon (tracker-miner-fs-3) and tools to extract metadata from many different filetypes.

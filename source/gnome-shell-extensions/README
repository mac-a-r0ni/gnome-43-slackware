GNOME Shell Extensions is a collection of extensions providing 
additional and optional functionality to GNOME Shell.
Since GNOME Shell is not API stable, extensions work only against a 
very specific version of the shell, usually the same as this package 
(see "configure --version"). The extensions in this package are 
supported by GNOME and will be updated to reflect future API changes in 
GNOME Shell.

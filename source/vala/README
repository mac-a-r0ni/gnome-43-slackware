Vala

Vala is a programming language using modern high level abstractions without imposing additional runtime
requirements and without using a different ABI compared to applications and libraries written in C.
Vala uses the GObject type system and has additional code generation routines that make targeting the
GNOME stack simple. Vala has many other uses where native binaries are required.

This is included in Slackware proper, but is not up to date, and causes applications to fail
building unless the latest stable release is available (see: gnome-clocks for an example). Also,
Vala builds on Slackware 15.0 but seems to fail on -current currently.
